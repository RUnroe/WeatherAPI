# WeatherAPI
Displays the current weather through a openweathermap API

### DESCRIPTION ###
The javascript grabs a json file every 10 seconds from a weather API. It then displays it on the HTML.

### WHAT I LEARNED ###
I learned how to get data through an API, using an API key. I also learned how to read API documentation to navigate through the data provided.
